# AI Doctor

AI Doctor is an intelligent, AI-powered medical assistant designed to understand patient symptoms through voice input, analyze them using natural language understanding, and provide helpful medical suggestions. This project leverages advanced speech recognition and natural language processing techniques to offer an interactive healthcare consultation experience.

## Features

- **Voice Input:** Patients can describe their symptoms verbally, making the interaction natural and user-friendly.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** The system processes and interprets the spoken symptoms to understand the patient's condition accurately.
- **Medical Suggestions:** Based on the analysis, the assistant provides relevant medical advice or suggests potential conditions.
- **Interactive Interface:** Utilizes [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) to create an accessible web-based interface for users.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following key files and directories:

- `brain_of_the_doctor.py`: Handles the processing and analysis of patient symptoms.
- `voice_of_the_patient.py`: Manages the capture and transcription of the patient's voice input.

- `gradio_app.py`: Sets up the Gradio interface for user interaction.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary Python packages to run the application.
- `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`: Used for managing the project's virtual environment with Pipenv.
- `presentation.pdf` and `ai-doctor-voicebit-ppt.pdf`: Provide an overview and detailed explanation of the project.
- Image files: Sample images related to medical conditions.
- Audio files (`*.mp3`): Sample voice inputs and outputs for testing purposes.
